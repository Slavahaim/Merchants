Ruby on Rails Test Task
We would like you to create a small web application, which is slightly similar to one of the projects you could potentially work on. You will make a web application with info about merchants from all over the world.

To show your git skills, please upload the application to your GitHub repo. Don’t forget
about clean commit messages and branch names.

Requirements:
● The application should use PostgreSQL

● Basic authentication using devise gem

● CRUD for Merchants (mandatory fields: name, city, street, country_code, extra (jsonb: extra info about merchant - phone_number, website))

● Think of some rules (validations) each merchant must satisfy, and express it in the application

● On the merchants index page add a full-text search filter by merchant name

● Integrate bootstrap and add some css styles to the created pages so they look good

Bonus points for:

● Unit tests (use Rspec)

● Roles for users, so they can(not) CRUD merchants depending on their role

Here are some resources to help you, in case you are not familiar with:

● Postgres (https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/index.html)

● RSpec (https://rspec.info/documentation/3.9/rspec-core/)

● Devise (https://github.com/heartcombo/devise)

● Bootstrap (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/)

● ActiveRecord (https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html)

● Full-Text Search (https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/textsearch.html)
